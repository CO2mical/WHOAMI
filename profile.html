        <h3>and now my life story</h3>
        <p id="profile-p-1">
          Altough born in Brussels, i've lived here in Vlissingen most of my
          life since the age of two. Since then i've grown to love the area. The
          sea, the people, the food and culture here is one of, if not<i>the</i>
          best in the country. the proximity to nature is also something i've
          grown to love more and more. And altough it's not the size of places
          like Amsterdam or the Hague, a place like Middelburg is unique in it's
          very own way. The rustic, homely feeling in the small towns here in
          Zeeland is not something I think i could ever give up for a long time.
        </p>
        <p id="profile-p-1">
          In the last few years i've started my own company doing 3d printing
          and design. I've worked with companies who design helical wind
          turbines, 3d print in concrete, and use the tide to power cities. This
          job has brought me all over europe, and even to the United States this
          year, when I did a job in Stuart, Florida. I've put that on the
          backburned to focus on my studies now, but knows what life will have
          in store.
