    <!--question 3-->
    <details class="content box">
      <summary>How can you book a project space?</summary>
      <p>There's a very specific step-by-step plan on how to do this on the hz website.
        I'm going to lead you to the step-by-step plan. Firstly you're going to go to the myhz site. You
        need to log in to follow the rest of the instructions. If you have trouble signing in, you should
        ask a teacher for help.
        You should see a page with the 'Welcome back' text. Click on the 'Change my personal menu' button.
        Find the 'Selfservice Portal' and add it to your home menu. Save the changes and head back to the
        'Welcome back' page.
        Click on the Selfservice Portal and press the 'reservation' button. You should be able to see a
        stickman figure with a red background
        with the text 'How do I make a reservation?'. Follow the instructions on that page and you should be
        able to reserve a room!

      <p> The student card is useful for a lot of things!
        You need it to print documents from your laptop, you can borrow books from the libary and you can
        enter
        the JRCZ ( If you completed the short trainingtest). You can only print documents if you have enough
        balance on your card.
        You can put more money on the card by using the ATM of the Hz. You'll find the ATM on the right side
        of the receptiondesk.</p>
